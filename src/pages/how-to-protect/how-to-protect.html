                     <p class="wow fadeInDown">
                        Our goal with Cliiimb is to have a safe space for minors where they can search content that will add value to them, educate them, inspire them, and encourage them to grow into the best version of themselves.
                     </p>
    
                     <p class="wow fadeInDown">
                        We have placed security checkpoints on the system for any person under 18 who wishes to join Cliiimb:
                     </p>
                     <ul class="wow fadeInDown">
                        <li>•  When a person creates a profile on Cliiimb, we require them to disclose their age.</li>
                        <li>•  When a minor (someone younger than 18) signs up for Cliiimb, they must provide contact information, such as name and email, of the parent or guardian of the minor.  The minor profile will not be approved and live yet.</li>
                        <li>•  The parent or guardian of the minor is sent an email that states the minor is attempting to join Cliiimb</li>
                        <li>•  In the email notification, the parent or guardian is prompted to create a profile on Cliiimb for themselves. Once the parent or guardian does this, they will have the power to approve the minor’s profile and make it live in the system</li>
                        <li>•  Once the minor’s profile is approved by the parent / guardian, all activities that the minor does on the system is communicated to the parent / guardian profile.  Everything the minor profile sees (such as what content they view) and does (such as interacting with contributors and mentors) on the system, the parent / guardian profile sees.  It is a completely transparent interface for the parent / guardian to view the activities of the minor on the Cliiimb system.</li>
                      </ul>
      
      
                     <h4 class="wow fadeInDown">Our Standards for Cliiimb Content</h4>
                     <p class="wow fadeInDown">
                        We do due diligence on every published piece of Cliiimb content to ensure that each content piece is substantive, well written, and interesting to audiences by contributors with relevant experience and expertise on the subject matter. We endeavor to have content that it is considerate to the reader while maintaining impartiality and encouraging discourse. We flag and actively discourage any content that would be considered intentionally rude, inflammatory, derogatory, or construed as troll bait. All contributor content must adhere to our Prohibited Content Policy, Terms of Use, and Terms of Service.
                     </p>
      
      
                     <h4 class="wow fadeInDown">Our Standards for Mentors</h4>
                     <p class="wow fadeInDown">
                        Every person who wishes to become a mentor must first go through a thorough vetting process:
                     </p>
    
                     <ul class="wow fadeInDown">
                        <li>•  Complete a formal written application</li>
                        <li>•  Have at least five pieces of contributor content be approved by the Cliiimb Newsroom</li>
                        <li>•  Submit to a background check and provide at least three professional references</li>
                        <li>•  Schedule an in-person interview with the Cliiimb Newsroom</li>
                      </ul>
    
                      <p class="wow fadeInDown">
                          The safety of your child is our highest priority, and our application and interview processes for mentors are very thorough.
                       </p>
                       <p class="wow fadeInDown">
                          All of our mentors are thrilled to be a part of Cliiimb and are willing to share their knowledge, skills, and expertise with youth.  They have an interest in imparting their wisdom and mentorship and wish to motivate our youth by setting a good example through how they live personally and professionally.
                       </p>
    
          
      
                     <h4 class="wow fadeInDown">Our Standards for Events</h4>
                     <p class="wow fadeInDown">
                        Everyone that represents Cliiimb at our events are individuals that we have vetted and are there to add value – the same exact process we have in place for our mentors.
                     </p>
                     <p class="wow fadeInDown">
                        To ensure the safety of minors, all unaccompanied minors attending events must have a completed permission slip / medical release form completed by their parent / guardian.
                     </p>
                     <h4 class="wow fadeInDown">Our Events Checklist:</h4>
