                        Content we receive will not be published simultaneously - it will go through an approval process, editing, additional content integration, media integration, and prep for launch via our schedule. </p>

                     <p class="wow fadeInDown">
                        Contributions may be collected together to tell a story regarding a particular topic, modified and expanded upon in order to enhance the content, or augmented with digital media such as images and YouTube videos (if any relevant videos are found).  If a contribution is exceptionally good, we may go out of our way to create custom digital media to enhance the content (e.g. we use our videographer and film team to do an interview with the author about the subject and add that finished media piece to the content).
