           <h1 class="text-center">About Us</h1>
          
            <p class="wow fadeInDown">We can’t do it alone. We need our community leaders, professionals, and everyone who feel our passion to contribute in our effort. </p>
            
            <h4 class="wow fadeInDown">Cliiimb addresses an important problem</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInDown">Young people are facing challenges unlike those of prior generations. These challenges include high rates of unemployment and underemployment, financial struggles, including student loan debt, a low desire to pursue entrepreneurship, and depression.</p>
      
      
            <h4 class="wow fadeInDown">Cliiimb responds to the problem</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInDown">It aims to touch the lives of young people and help them rise up from the challenges facing them in order to become their best selves. To help drive this mission, it utilizes community leaders and professionals who will draw them into helpful community networks, offer life guidance and support, and provide career information from years of expertise and wisdom in the workforce.</p>
      
      
            <h4 class="wow fadeInDown">How does Cliiimb work? </h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInDown"><strong>Cliiimb</strong> is a next generation communication tool for mobile devices. It was created so that local professionals can collectively work together to connect and engage our young people on relevant issues that affect them. We aim to have a transformative impact on local communities by fostering future leaders who will contribute to their advancement and prosperity.</p>
      
      
            <h4 class="wow fadeInDown">Living by example</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInDown">The <strong>Cliiimb</strong> communication tool can enable young people to connect with accomplished professionals who will freely share expertise, knowledge, talents, and mentoring. Eventually, after the young people have used the <strong>Cliiimb</strong> platform, they will see for themselves that these accomplished professionals just happen to be committed towards moral grounding. Once the “bridge” back to a moral focus has been established, now their journey begins to develop and reinforce a great start for their family via successful rails.</p>
      
            <h4 class="wow fadeInDown">Why are we asking for your help?</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInDown">We believe that community leaders and professionals who have moral grounding are the best examples to impart life-changing wisdom and are exemplary role models who can have a positive impact on young people. With your help, we can empower our young people and give them a sense of self-worth and opportunity, increase their social competency, and improve their academic and professional prospects.</p>
      
            <h4 class="wow fadeInDown">How can you help?</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInDown">We are seeking your participation as a <strong>“Contributor”</strong> to get involved by contributing your experiences, knowledge, in the form of articles, blogs, Vlogs, video content, podcast, music, poems, image visuals, art, stories, history, etc to the collective. Your professional background, thought leadership, and expertise can play an important role in guiding the development of today’s young people into tomorrow’s leaders. With your help, let’s make a HUGE impact for our young people.</p>
      
      
            <p class="wow fadeInDown">Let’s <strong>“Cliiimb”</strong> together.</p>
      
      
            <p class="wow fadeInDown"><strong>Interested in becoming a contributor with us? Share Cliiimb with your professional friends and colleagues and invite to join this mission with us.</strong></p>
